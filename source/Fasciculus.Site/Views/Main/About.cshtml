<h2>Name and Logo</h2>

<p>A wooden rod or slab can be broken easily.</p>

<p>
    If you bind several of them together, you get a "bundle" (Latin: "fascis").<br />
    A bundle is stronger than a single rod.<br />
    That's the logo.
</p>

<p>
    The Latin word for a small bundle is "fasciculus".<br />
    Hence the name.
</p>
